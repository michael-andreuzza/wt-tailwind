##Hello DEV's
Let me tell you...


##The Story
I woke up today with a notification from Reddit. Someone answered a question I had months back. That was really kind.

I asked if there was a way to convert a Figma file to a Sketch file...
Mostly because I don't do Mac products...and I needed a .sketch file to put the colours from my website, so the users from sketch can download them for free too. It was not fair for them...I guess.

This was early in the morning, so I had to sneak out of the room to don't wake up my wife and daughter...

I Opened Figma and there it was, shiny as a diamond:
###- [CONVERTIFY](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/849159306117999028/Convertify-Figma-to-Sketch).
**"Convert and export your designs from Figma to Sketch with a single click"**

Well, now we got it. let me show them to you.

This is how it looks. Is not purple, is dark grey, but when I save the png it looks too weird...
